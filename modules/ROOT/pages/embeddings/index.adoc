= What are embeddings?

Embeddings are numerical representations of content, such as texts or images.
Embeddings are an attempt to encode language into a form that machines can work with: lists of numbers.

This tutorial aims at being able to query movies based on a description, so you will create embeddings for movies' titles and plots.
Each movie node will get an extra property, that looks like absolute gibberish at the human eye, but that makes it possible for vector indexes to parse content.

For example, the picture below shows the text for the movie `Despicable Me` and its corresponding embedding.

Embeddings are always generated _out_ of Neo4j, but _stored_ in the Neo4j database.
This tutorial shows how to generate embeddings both with open source libraries and with external AI providers (supported providers are OpenAI, Vertex AI, Azure OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock).

[TIP]
**You should always use the same model to generate embeddings for a dataset**: pick one and use it to generate embeddings all throughout this tutorial.

_How_ a piece of text is encoded into an embedding is a whole field of research of its own and is out of the scope of this tutorial, which only shows how to _use_ them.

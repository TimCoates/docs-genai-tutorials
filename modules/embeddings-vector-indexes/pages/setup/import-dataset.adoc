= Import dataset

This tutorial is based on the link:https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/recommendations/tree/main[recommendations dataset], so the first step is to import its _dump file_ into your Neo4j instance.
You can import the dump file both into a self-managed DBMS instance and into a cloud Aura instance.


== Neo4j Aura

To import the recommendations dataset on an Aura instance, download the file link:https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/recommendations/raw/main/data/recommendations-50.dump[recommendations-50.dump] and upload it into the `Import Database` tab of your instance.
For more information, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/auradb/importing/import-database/[Aura -> Import database].

After the import completes, go on to xref:setup/environment.adoc[set up your environment].


== Neo4j DBMS

To import the recommendations dataset on a self-managed instance, download the file link:https://github.com/neo4j-graph-examples/recommendations/raw/main/data/recommendations-50.dump[recommendations-50.dump] and place it in the directory where Neo4j is running from (use `docker cp` to copy it to a Neo4j Docker container).

[TIP]
====
If working with a Neo4j Docker container, ensure you connect to it with the user `neo4j` before issuing import commands, or you will get permission issues after the import.

[source, shell]
----
docker container exec -u neo4j -it <containerName> /bin/bash
----
====

To import the dataset, use the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/backup-restore/restore-dump/[`neo4j-admin database load`] command and create a new database with the *same name* as the dump file.

[source, shell]
----
bin/neo4j-admin database load recommendations-50 --from-path=./
bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p <databasePassword> -d system 'CREATE DATABASE `recommendations-50` WAIT'
----

To verify that the import was successful, check that the count for `Movie` nodes is 9125.

[source, shell]
----
bin/cypher-shell -u neo4j -p <databasePassword> -d recommendations-50 'MATCH (:Movie) RETURN count(*)'
----

[source, shell, role=nocopy]
----

| count(*) |

Now continue to xref:setup/environment.adoc[set up your environment].
